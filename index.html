                     Education is what differentiates us from other living beings on earth.
                      It makes man the smartest creature on earth. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">First of all, Education teaches the ability to read and write. 
            Reading and writing is the first step in Education. Most information is done by writing. 
            Hence, the lack of writing skill means missing out on a lot of information.
            Consequently, Education makes people literate.
        Above all, Education is extremely important for employment. It certainly is a great opportunity to make a decent living. This is due to the skills of a high paying job that Education provides.
         Uneducated people are probably at a huge disadvantage when it comes to jobs. It seems like many poor people improve their lives with the help of Education.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms.
             Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Enhance your knowledge here</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can also be a useful tool in personal development. This can include activities such as learning new skills, creating a personal development plan (PDP), developing talents, creating human capital, developing spiritually, or improving self-knowledge.
             Even the action of teaching others can help improve oneself.The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible.[citation needed] Finnish schools have begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.[111] There are also active educational interventions to implement programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as first generation students.

             Education is also becoming[when?] a commodity no longer reserved for children;[citation needed] adults need it too.[112] Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have proposed compulsory lifelong education.</p>
